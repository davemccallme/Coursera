Data Engineering Fundamentals Certificate

As of February 2023, I'm currently taking a Professional Certificate course that helps me develop the skills and tools I need to become a data engineer. The course is self-paced and entirely online, which allows me to learn at my own pace. Throughout the course, I will immerse myself in the role of a data engineer and learn how to work with different databases and tools to manage both structured and unstructured data.

By the end of the course, I will be able to perform key tasks required in a data engineering role. I will learn how to use Python and Linux/UNIX shell scripts to extract, transform and load (ETL) data. Additionally, I will work with Relational Databases (RDBMS) and use SQL statements to query data. I'll also learn how to work with NoSQL databases and big data engines such as Hadoop and Spark. Additionally, I will gain experience with creating data warehouses and use business intelligence tools to analyze and extract insights.

The best part is that when I complete the program, I can earn up to 12 college credits, which is fantastic.

Throughout the course, I will complete various hands-on labs and projects to help me gain practical experience in working with Python, SQL, different types of databases, Apache Spark, building data pipelines, managing databases, and working with data warehouses. Some of the projects I will work on include designing a relational database for a coffee franchise, using SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic data sets, and training a machine learning model by creating an Apache Spark application.

Overall, I am excited to learn and gain new skills that will help me become a better data analyst through this Data Engineering Fundamentals Professional Certificate program.
